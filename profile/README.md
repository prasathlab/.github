The [Prasath Lab](https://www.prasathlab.com/) uses AI/Data Science Tools for Biomedical Informatics

We combine mathematics, computer science, and statistics to solve challenging biomedical informatics problems with special emphasis in pediatric domain. We use image processing, computer vision, machine and deep learning for large-scale biomedical imaging and multi-modal data. We do science that is collaborative and crosses disciplines. We follow a culture that is integrative and inclusive.

We are a group of young professionals aiming to develop computational tools for extracting insights from various biomedical data modalities. Our lab conducts leading interdisciplinary research in the fields of image processing, computer vision, and machine/deep learning for text, imaging, videos and multi-dimensional multi-modal data. Our team works together with clinicians, biologists, medical doctors with the common goal of accelerating data-driven discovery and facilitating bench-to-bedside translational science with special emphasize in the pediatrics domain. We are data modality-agnostic, discipline-agnostic, tools-agnostic and love challenges posed by messy real-world big-data. We are also fun-loving, but serious data-wranglers so please do not hesitate to contact if you would like to join us!
